Okay, 

So as I mentioned yesterday, the 'Value' that comes out of the calculator is the premium that goes to the insurance underwriters to insure the risk for the 12 month period.

As Lancaster (And other future clients) will be brokers, they make a fee to distribute and look after the policy.

Because of this, one thing that will be getting A/B tested to maximise CRO and AOV will be the total price. The 'arrangement fee' will be between £0 and £40.

So, next to the 'Premium' column that comes out the calculator, we need the price (i.e. what the customer receives), so the adjacent row will need to be 'Value + x', with x being 0-70 depending on what we want it at.

Secondly, as mentioned, customers can pay monthly. Depending on ages of drivers products etc this recommends a good A/B test for the copy as different people have different spending methods.

The deposit will always be 20% of the total customer final price, so this needs to have a built in excel calculator.

Finally, the monthly instalment price. This will be the total customer final price multiplied by 0.8 (Leftover price minus the deposit) 

The 80% of the price needs to be multiplied by 16% (The 16% is the interest a third party financial credit provider make)

It then needs to be divided by 10, making up the figure for ten monthly instalments.

EXAMPLE.


Risk goes through calc, the premiumm fired out is £312.44

We're testing an arrangement fee of £40, so the customer price is £352.44

The deposit is 20% of the customer price, so that will be £70.49

The ten monthly instalments are £32.71, after the interest is added.

Probably easiest if the four Columns in the qzone sheets read as 'PREMIUM' 'PREMIUM + FEE' 'DEPOSIT' 'MONTHLY INSTALLMENTS'
